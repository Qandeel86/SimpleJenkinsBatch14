CI/CD:
    continuous integration and continents development.
    All the software that we use, weather it is a website or app or any operating system,
    they are in a continuous state of change. We need to continuously develop and update
    these software so that the customer can use the latest features. Jenkins is one such
    software that will help us automate this process.
1)  Once the software is ready and looks good on the developers machine, developer
    pushes that code to the development server. He verifies the changes and runs a few
    test cases to make sure all works fine.
2)  Once all looks good, QA will request to deploy the changes on QA server. We also need
    to take approvals from team leads or managers, which further slows down this process.
3)  Once all looks good on QA take approval from head of team write an email again to
    deploy all the changes to the staging server.
4)  Once all look good on staging do the same for the production.
